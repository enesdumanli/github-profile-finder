This is a Github profile finder application. You can inspect any github profile with details. 
You can see how many repositories user has and browse them by clicking. There is a basic
information about user, like how many followers user has and how many user following.
You can browse user's github profile by clicking View on github. 

I used hooks, states, router, github api for this app.
